The proposed project titled under UCR is “5.35 KW Micro Scale Solar Power Project by Francis Almon, 
Ucassaim, Goa.” This is a micro scale grid-connected, roof-top Solar PV installation located on a residential 
dwelling belonging to the PP. 

The project activity is situated at House #: 236, Ward: Lourdes Waddo, Village: Ucassaim, Taluka: Mapusa, 
District: Bardez,  State: Goa, Country: India, Pin Code: 403507. 

This is an operational project that consistently reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and is currently being 
registered under the Universal Carbon Registry (UCR). 

The proposed bundled project comprises of a single grid-connected, roof-top Solar PV installation with a 
total installed capacity of 5.35 KW. The electricity generated under this solar initiative is distributed 
through the state grid via a long-term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA).  In Goa, Electricity Department 
Goa (EDG) is the implementing agency for all of the “Grid Connected Rooftop Solar Programmes,” and the 
EDG has entrusted the Goa Energy Development Agency (GEDA), the State nodal agency under MNRE for 
the implementation of the said programme. EDG plays a key role in providing approval for installation and 
Grid Connectivity, managing the distribution network and billing with the rooftop owner (PP). Mr Francis 
Almon is the project owner and representative for the purpose of project submission, coordination, and 
ongoing management under the carbon credit project, ensuring compliance and coordination with the 
relevant processes.
